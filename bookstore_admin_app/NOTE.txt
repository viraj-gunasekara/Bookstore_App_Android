##Issues
1)forget pw reset link - for random email also show as reset link sent. - Firebase returns "Mail sent" even for unknown emails — but the email never actually arrives. 
*From the Firebase Docs: To prevent email enumeration, this method always returns success regardless of whether an email exists or not.
