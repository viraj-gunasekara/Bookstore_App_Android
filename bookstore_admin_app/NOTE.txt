#Email/Password Authentication (Sign-In/Sign-up), how to enabled in your Firebase project?
1)Go to your project: https://console.firebase.google.com
2)Go to Authentication Section > Sign-in method
3)Click Email/Password → Enable → Save

#Issues
1)forget pw reset link - for random email also show as reset link sent. - Firebase returns "Mail sent" even for unknown emails — but the email never actually arrives. 
*From the Firebase Docs: To prevent email enumeration, this method always returns success regardless of whether an email exists or not.
